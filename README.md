# Arduino Music Player

Play music with an Arduino Uno! Currently programmed to play the theme from Super Mario Bros. You can see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/cIcVx7mDaaE). 
All components can be found in the Arduino Uno starter kit. They are:

- Arduino Uno
- LEDs
- Piezo speaker
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Setup

- Connect the piezo speaker to the Arduino; one end into the digital pin, and the other to the ground (via a 100ohm resistor)
- Connect the LEDs to the Arduino, one end into the digital pin, and the other to the groun (via a 220ohm resistor)
